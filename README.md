## Business Request

As a Health and Safety professional working for the US Division at a Construction firm, I was asked by my Divisional Manager to design a dashboard that would enable him to track accident data for the period between July, 1 2015 and August, 10 2017. He wanted something interactive that would change based on the following selected criteria: 

- Body parts that were injured.
- The project type the injured person was working on at the time of the accident.
- The stories of the building being built.
- The end use of the construction site.
- The nature of the injuries sustained.

## Overview

- Structuring of the [data](https://github.com/davidgomezpr1/PowerBI_PersonalStepTracking/blob/Portfolio_Projects/StepTrackingNov21.xlsx) into a Fact(`FACT_Activity`) and Dimension Tables(`DIM_Date` & `DIM_Activity`).
- Cleaning of data, leveraging the `Power Query Editor`. Creation of new columns and measures.
- Design of an interactive body part schematic, utilizing the Synoptic #panel visual for Power BI.
- Applied conditional formatting to the KPI cards.
